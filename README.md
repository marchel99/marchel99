# 🔵  About Me:
👨‍💻 Pursuing my master's degree in Electronics and Telecommunication<br>
🖨️ 3D Printing enthustiast<br>
🌱 Currently learning C/C++

------------------
I'm a fourth-year student at Lodz University of Technology with a passion for 3D modeling, electronics, and embedded systems. I have experience with programming languages such as C/C++, and I enjoy experimenting with new hardware and software technologies to create innovative projects.

On my Github profile, you'll find a collection of my projects, ranging from simple LED blinking projects to complex robotic systems. I believe in open-source software and hardware, and I love sharing my knowledge with others by contributing to various Github repositories.

One of the areas where I believe my skills in 3D modeling can truly shine is in creating custom enclosures, cases, and structures for my electronic projects. I believe that the combination of 3D modeling, electronics, and programming has tremendous potential for innovation, and I'm excited to explore this area further.

Feel free to take a look at my Github profile and reach out to me for collaboration or project ideas. I'm always excited to work on new and challenging projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in electronics and programming.
