# Hello, World! 🚀
Welcome! I'm Kuba, a passionate master's student in Electronics and Telecommunication at Lodz University of Technology. Despite being entangled in the academic world, I've managed to sharpen my skills in C and C++ programming languages, and the captivating art of electronics. Currently, I'm in the heart of the 3D printing industry, bringing my 3D modeling skills to the table. My portfolio includes an autonomous car project, a 1:50 scale smart home model, and a music box for a child - all designed with a blend of 3D printing technology, coding, and electronic circuit design.

But that's not where I plan to stop. The ultimate destination of my academic journey and work experience is to plunge into the exciting world of Embedded Systems. On my GitHub profile, you'll see a fusion of practical designs and cool, eye-catching projects. Because let's be real, who ever said practical couldn't be cool, right?
